<p>You can 3D print the two halves of the sphere with a soft rubber filament, you can find the models <a href= "https://github.com/ADO-ArduinoDisabilityOrchestra/O-some/blob/master/Case/dome.stl">here</a>.
You can also 3D print the four pegs that keep the case shut with a medium-soft rubber filament, you can find the models <a href= "https://github.com/ADO-ArduinoDisabilityOrchestra/O-some/blob/master/Case/peg.stl">here</a>.
In order to keep the IMUduino protected from too much squishing you can laser-cut a protective ring, you can find the DXF file <a href = "https://github.com/ADO-ArduinoDisabilityOrchestra/O-some/blob/master/Case/rigid_ring.dxf">here</a>.
